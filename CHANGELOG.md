# Change Log

Changelog document for Hill Holliday's Boilerplate


# 1.0.3
- Fixed Modernizr config settings to properly allow `grunt modernizr` to create a new file based on tests config array. Additionally set crawl to `false` which was causing to grunt to not build a new file.
- Updated Node version to '>=4.0.0' since the LTS version is 4.3.3, less dependencies unmet this way.
